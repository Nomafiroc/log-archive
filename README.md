https://roadmap.sh/projects/log-archive-tool

This is a log archiving tool, you provide it with a directory and it makes an archive out of it using tar

timestamp was gathered via date

to use this script, first copy/download it
then in your CLI, use this command

  chmod +x {filename}

then run the file using 
  ./{filename}

this wont work unless you have bash so either get that set up or make some changes to the file and the command to make it run without any issues
